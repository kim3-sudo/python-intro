# Python 3 Cheat Sheets

## A series of open-source cheat-sheets for Python 3 for introductory students of computer science

If you are looking to print this, please use the printable PDF version unless you're willing to typeset the entire document yourself. I'm not helping you.

If you want to view a web-based version, you can view the WebReadable markdown version or open the Jupyter Notebook version on GitHub. You can also download and run the Jupyter Notebook on your own machine. There is no support available for you if you choose to do so.

If you are looking for an interactive version (I know, right) *and* you're a Kenyon student, check out this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pWF_rzuI7mHoVIqAZ2QSYf7WUk5X4e_?usp=sharing). You can view the entire notebook and run any of the code snippets within Colab! Spiffy!
