Other languages include C++, Haskell, Ruby, R, Java, JavaScript, and even Ada. Once you pick up Python, though, you’ll find that other programming languages don’t look so different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note is, development, to most people, is not inherently fun. I know, right? In reality, the act of coding is full of twists and turns, and it’s not easy. However, the joy of coding comes with the things that you can do with your code. Think of code as a tool that you can do so many other things with.\n",

However, we encourage you to walk through coding exercises on your own. This is only an introductory text for reading and developing in Python."

    "\n",
    "The first and foremost is called an IDE, or integrated development environment. That's just a fancy way of saying a place where you can write and run code that you write. repl.it, Google Colaboratory, Apple Xcode and Microsoft Visual Studio are all IDEs. IDEs can be broken down into two fundamental components: a text editor and a compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "A text editor is pretty simple. It's a place where you can edit plain text. If you're on a Mac, you can use Apple Textedit, and if you're on PC, you can use Notepad. Don’t confuse these with software packages like Microsoft Word, Google Sheets, or Apple Pages.  You can also download different text editors, like BBEdit for Mac, Atom for Mac, PC and Linux, or Notepad++ for PC and Linux, and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. There's also text editors that can run in the terminal, like emacs and nano.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler is a little bit more complicated. We code in Python, but computers can't natively understand Python. Python would be what developers call \"source code\", and it's almost always human readable, but not machine readable. (There are some source code languages that aren't human readable, like BrainF, but these are fringe cases.) When we want to run a bit of our source code, we need to translate it into something that our computers can understand. This happens in two stages. The first stage converts our source code into assembly code, instructions that the computer can then break down. Assembly code is only readable to the trained eye, and is difficult to think about intuitively. The second stage breaks code down to machine code, or the 1's and 0's that the computer can understand, but that isn't human-readable.\n",

For a more concrete example check out the [demo](https://processing.org/examples/integersfloats.html)[^1] here, where you can see how the top line represents a big loop with an int, and the bottom line represents the same loop, but with a float.\n",
    "- `complex` variables can also hold imaginary numbers; think back to Algebra 2. Remember how `sqrt(-1)` can be represented as an `i` in an equation? Complex variables can also hold imaginary numbers, and define them using a j. For example, `2*i` in math would be written as `2j` in a complex variable.\n",

Initialization is a fancy way of saying that we want to put something into a variable that we've declared. For example, we might declare a boolean variable called `varsityAthlete`, but it has no meaning until we initialize it with some data, like `True`.\n",

    "Variables exist in almost every single modern programming language. Different programming languages deal with variables differently, but again, Python makes things pretty easy, since it doesn't require you to explicitly define the variable type. By using a single equal sign =, we can initialize and declare a variable in one fell swoop. Python will do its best to figure out what kind of variable it is, depending on what kind of information you give it. Let's look at an example.\n"

In this example, my function name is linear, and my arguments are m, x, and b.\n",

Python has three distinct security types: public, private, and protected. A public variable can be accessed anywhere in the program. As long as you have the address of that variable, you can grab its contents. This is convenient, but not secure. You can protect an instance variable by adding a `_` (single underscore) to the beginning of the variable. This effectively prevents the variable from being accessed, unless it is within a sub-class. Lastly, you can add a double underscore `__` to make the variable private. This tells Python to keep this data private at all costs. Any attempt to touch the data by an unauthorized force results in an AttributeError. Consider the following code."

Python calls its code libraries “modules,” and there are literally hundreds of thousands of modules available through two major package distributors: `pip`[^8] and `conda`[^9].

However, the difference between writing and appending is a little bit more nebulous. Appending to a file opens that file as a readable file, but only writes to the end of that file. An appending operation cannot modify existing data. An overwriting or writing operation opens the file as a writable file, and it, by default, replaces and rewrites the new data over the old data. Writing operations are destructive!\n",
